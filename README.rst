Native Wechat Payments.

**Native** here means that Wechat mobile app must be used in order to perform
a payment.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install git+https://github.com/vericant/wechat_pay.git@0.5#egg=wechat_pay

Usage
=====

First of all you need to initialize an object:

.. code-block:: python

    from wechat_pay import WechatPay

    payment = WechatPay('<app id>', '<merchant id>', '<payments key>',
                        '<notify url>', '<server ip>')

Make a prepay request
---------------------

.. code-block:: python

    data = payment.retrieve_prepay_data('<product name>', '<transaction no>',
                                        '<price>')

It will return a dictionary with a bunch of stuff. The part that is
particularly interesting here is **code_url** which looks something like this:
*weixin://wxpay/bizpayurl?pr=e42JWWu*

With this code you could then generate a QR-code image:

.. code-block:: sh

    qrencode -l H -t PNG -o qr.png 'weixin://wxpay/bizpayurl?pr=e42JWWu'

â€¦and show it to your user in order to let her pay.

Full explanation of how this works can be found in service documentation.

Validate notification
---------------------

Right after user makes a payment, Wechat server hits you back to <notify url>
you specified with POST request, body of which contains useful information.
Let's say you got it in the *xml* variable:

.. code-block:: python

    if payment.validate_notification(xml):
        # do something

Close order
-----------

Close the order. For following situations:
  1. The payment is failed, merchant need to generate new order so close the
     original order to avoid duplicated payments.
  2. Over the time, merchant need to close the order.

Note: The min gap time between request order and close the same order is 5
minutes.

.. code-block:: python

    data = payment.close_order('<transaction no>')

It will return a dictionary with a bunch of stuff if closed successfully.

The **'return_code'** in dictionary describe whether it's success/fail.

The **'err_code'** in dictionary describe the error code if it failed.

Full explanation of how this works and error code details can be found in service
documentation.

Integrations were traditionally hard to test, but not anymore.
